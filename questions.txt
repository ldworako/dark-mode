# TODO
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button
  - Utilise the *existing* dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to the root `html` element
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.

# What's Already Been Done
- Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
